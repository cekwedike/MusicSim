# MusicSim Analysis Report (Initial Scaffold)

## 1. Original Objectives (Excerpt)
Summarize proposal goals: educational effectiveness, strategic decision learning, user engagement, career outcome variability.

## 2. Data Sources
- Gameplay telemetry (scenario choices, outcomes)
- Learning module progress & quiz performance
- Career completion statistics
- User testing feedback & SUS scores
- Achievement distributions

## 3. Metrics & Definitions
| Metric | Definition | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Career Success Rate | Completed careers / attempts | Measures mastery progression |
| Avg Quiz Score | Mean of module quiz percentages | Indicates learning retention |
| Module Completion % | Completed modules / total modules | Engagement depth |
| Decision Accuracy | Beneficial decisions / total decisions | Strategic learning |
| Time-on-Learning Ratio | Time in learning modules / total session | Balance of play vs study |

## 4. Preliminary Findings (Placeholder)
To be filled after data extraction scripts and user study.

## 5. Interpretation Framework
Use correlations (e.g. Pearson r between quiz score & career success) and trend charts to assess learning impact.

## 6. Variance & Edge Case Review
Identify outlier sessions (very short, very long, extreme fame spikes) for quality insights.

## 7. Limitations
Current absence of longitudinal retention, small N user test until expanded, simulated data in early phase.

## 8. Improvement Actions
List prioritized feature or content adjustments derived from insights.

## 9. Future Work
Long-term retention study, adaptive difficulty, personalized learning path refinement.
