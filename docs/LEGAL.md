## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **MusicSim**, a gamified learning platform designed to empower independent artists in Nigeria and Rwanda with essential music business knowledge. This document explains what data we collect and why, how we protect your information, your rights as a user, and terms of use for the platform.

**By using MusicSim, you agree to these terms.** If you don't agree, please don't use the platform.

We've written this in plain language because we believe you deserve to understand exactly how your information is handled. This isn't just a legal formality—it's our commitment to transparency and respect for your privacy.

---

## 3. What Data We Collect

We believe in **data minimization**—we only collect what's necessary to provide you with a meaningful learning experience and improve the platform.

### 3.1 Account Information

When you create an account through **Google OAuth**, we collect:
- **Email address** (from your Google account)
- **Username or display name**
- **Profile picture** (optional)

**What We Don't Collect:**
- Physical addresses
- Phone numbers
- Payment information (the platform is free)
- Detailed career histories
- Access to your Gmail, Drive, or other Google services

We deliberately minimize data collection. This means we ask for name and profile picture instead of addresses, and genres instead of detailed career histories.

### 3.2 Learning Progress Data

As you use MusicSim, we track your learning progress, including:
- **Scenarios completed** and your progress through the game
- **Choices made in scenarios** to understand decision-making patterns
- **Achievement unlocks** and milestones reached
- **Quiz and assessment results** to measure learning outcomes
- **Time spent on the platform** to understand engagement
- **Difficulty mode selections** (e.g., Easy, Normal, Hard)
- **Contract review decisions** in game scenarios
- **Virtual career statistics** (followers, revenue, reputation—within the game only)

**Important Note:** This data helps us understand how effectively you're learning and where the platform can improve. The game data stays within your virtual career and doesn't expose your real business situation.

### 3.3 Technical Information

We automatically collect some technical information from your device:
- **Device type and operating system** (e.g., iPhone, Android, Windows, Mac)
- **Browser type and version** (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- **IP address** (stored temporarily and not linked to your profile)
- **Session duration** and activity timestamps
- **Performance metrics** (load times, errors encountered)

This technical data helps us optimize performance and identify issues across different devices and network conditions.

### 3.4 Research Data (Optional)

If you **consent to participate in research**, we may collect:
- **Anonymized survey responses** about your learning experience
- **Interview transcripts** (with all identifying information removed)
- **Aggregated usage patterns** for academic research

**Research participation is completely optional.** You can:
- ✅ Use all educational features without participating in research
- ✅ Decline research participation at any time
- ✅ Withdraw from research without affecting your access to learning content

Declining research doesn't affect your access to learning content.

---

## 4. How We Use Your Data

### 4.1 Platform Functionality

We use your **account information** to:
- **Authenticate your login** and maintain security
- **Save your learning progress** across devices
- **Personalize your learning experience** based on your progress
- **Track achievements and milestones**
- **Provide scenario recommendations** based on your progress

The platform needs this data to function properly and give you a consistent experience whether you're on your phone or a computer.

### 4.2 Platform Improvement

Your **usage data** helps us improve the platform. We analyze it to:
- **Identify bugs and technical issues** quickly
- **Understand which features** users find most helpful
- **Improve scenario content** and difficulty balancing
- **Optimize performance** for different devices and connection speeds

When we see patterns showing users struggle with certain concepts, we can adjust our educational approach.

### 4.3 Academic Research

For **academic research purposes**, we use aggregated, anonymized data to:
- **Measure learning outcomes** and knowledge gains
- **Evaluate cultural responsiveness** of the platform
- **Assess gamification effectiveness** in music business education
- **Publish findings** in academic journals and conferences

**Only anonymized, aggregated data appears in research publications.** Individual users cannot be identified.

### 4.4 What We Will NEVER Do

We will **never**:
- **Sell your data** to third parties
- **Share your individual learning progress** with anyone without your explicit consent
- **Use your data for commercial marketing**
- **Identify you personally** in research publications
- **Spam you** with promotional emails (only essential platform updates)

Your privacy matters more than any commercial opportunity.

---

## 5. How We Protect Your Data

We take data security seriously and implement multiple layers of protection.

### 5.1 Encryption

**Data in Transit:**
- All data transmitted between your device and our servers uses **TLS 1.3 encryption**
- This means nobody can intercept and read your information as it travels across the internet

**Data at Rest:**
- User data is stored in **Supabase's PostgreSQL database** with **AES-256 encryption at rest**
- This protects your data even if someone somehow accessed our servers

### 5.2 Authentication Security

We use **Google OAuth** for authentication, which means:
- ✅ You sign in with your existing Google account (secure and convenient)
- ✅ We receive **only** your email address and basic profile information from Google
- ✅ We **don't access** your Gmail, Drive, or other Google services
- ✅ You benefit from Google's robust security infrastructure

### 5.3 Data Architecture Security

Here's something important about our architecture:
- **Identification data** (name, email) is stored **separately** from **learning progress data**
- We use **tokenized user IDs** to connect these databases
- This means your learning data can't easily be traced back to your identity, even if one database was compromised

### 5.4 Access Controls

- **Only essential personnel** can access personal data
- All data access is **logged and monitored**
- Administrative access requires **multi-factor authentication**
- We conduct **regular security audits** and vulnerability assessments

### 5.5 Breach Notification

If a security breach occurs, we will:
1. **Notify you within 72 hours** via email
2. **Inform relevant authorities** (NITDA in Nigeria, RISA in Rwanda)
3. **Explain what data was affected** and what steps we're taking
4. **Provide guidance** on protecting yourself

Transparency during incidents matters as much as prevention.

### 6.5 Right to Data Portability

This supports your autonomy and prevents platform lock-in.

### 6.6 Right to Withdraw Consent

- ✅ This won't affect past processing done with your consent
- ✅ Or processing required for platform functionality you continue to use
- ✅ Example: Keep learning but stop participating in research
